# Laptop_Price_Predictor
Creating a laptop price predictor using a RandomForest Regressor model with GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning and deploying it using the Streamlit library is a great project idea! Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can approach this project:

**Step 1: Data Collection and Preparation**
1. Gather laptop data: Collect data about various laptops including features like processor, RAM, storage, graphics card, display size, etc., along with their corresponding prices.
2. Prepare the data: Clean the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables (using techniques like one-hot encoding), and splitting it into features (X) and target (y) variables.

**Step 2: Feature Selection and Engineering**
1. Analyze features: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of features and their relationships with the target variable.
2. Feature engineering: Create new relevant features if needed. For instance, you could calculate the total system memory by adding RAM and storage size.
3. Feature scaling: Normalize or standardize numerical features if required.

**Step 3: Model Building**
1. Split the data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
2. RandomForest Regressor: Import the necessary libraries and create a RandomForest Regressor model. This ensemble model is well-suited for predicting continuous values.
3. Hyperparameter tuning: Use GridSearchCV to search for the best hyperparameters for the model. Parameters to tune might include the number of trees, maximum depth, and minimum samples per leaf.
4. Fit the model: Train the RandomForest Regressor with the best parameters on the training data.

**Step 4: Model Evaluation**
1. Predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on the test dataset.
2. Evaluation metrics: Calculate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess the model's performance.

**Step 5: Streamlit App Development**
1. Install Streamlit: If you haven't already, install Streamlit using `pip install streamlit`.
2. Create a Streamlit app: Develop a Streamlit app (e.g., `app.py`) that allows users to input laptop specifications (features) and get a predicted price as output.
3. Import libraries: Import the necessary libraries like pandas and RandomForest Regressor.
4. Load the model: Load the trained RandomForest Regressor model.
5. Create the interface: Design the Streamlit interface with input widgets (text fields, sliders, etc.) for users to input laptop specifications.
6. Make predictions: Use the loaded model to make predictions based on the user's input.
7. Display results: Display the predicted laptop price on the Streamlit app.
